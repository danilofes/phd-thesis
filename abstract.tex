%Refactoring is an well-known technique that is widely adopted by software engineers to improve the design of an existing code base.

Refactoring is an important aspect of software development and a key factor to understand software evolution.
As such, several existing studies report and discuss refactoring practice on real software projects.
Unfortunately, such studies are often hindered by the difficulty of obtaining reliable information of refactoring activity from version histories.
Although there are approaches capable of detecting refactorings automatically, they still suffer from precision and recall problems.
In this thesis proposal, we first report a large scale study of refactoring practice, focusing on the motivations behind refactorings.
Then, we propose a new approach to detect refactoring in version histories, which has better precision and recall than existing solutions.
As a future work, we plan to extend its evaluation with a new study to assess its precision in real scenarios. 
Besides, we plan to employ our approach to build tools to aid the analysis of code changes of software components that went through refactoring.


% Short abstract
%Refactoring is an important aspect of software development and a key factor to understand software evolution. Unfortunately, empirical studies on refactoring are often hindered by the difficulty of obtaining reliable information of refactoring activity, and many questions remain open. In this thesis, we first report two large-scale empirical studies that rely on mining refactorings from version histories. Initially, we investigated the relationship between Extract Method refactoring and code reuse. Later, we investigated the motivations for refactorings applied to open source systems based on feedback from the developers who performed the refactorings. As result, we compiled a catalogue of 44 distinct motivations for 12 well-known refactoring types. Additionally, we propose and evaluate a novel approach to detect refactorings from version histories that supports multiple programming languages and offers high precision and recall.
