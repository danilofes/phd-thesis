IM & Eliminate unnecessary method & Inline and eliminate a method that is unnecessary or has become too trivial after code changes. & \minibarn{13}{15} \\
IM & Caller becomes trivial & Inline and eliminate a method because its caller method has become too trivial after code changes, so that it can absorb the logic of the inlined method without compromising readability. & \minibarn{2}{15} \\
